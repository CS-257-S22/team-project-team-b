Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."

"figures for 2000 are April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 intercensal series of July 1"
"estimates. Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population"
"figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which"
"were available at the time of release."
"5. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group."
"6. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More"
"information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"7. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
"2020."
