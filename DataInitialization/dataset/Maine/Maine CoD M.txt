Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."

"estimates. Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population"
"figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which"

"5. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"

"6. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"

"information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"7. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"

"2020."
